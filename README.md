# starter_kit
Start building full stack dApps fast with this starter kit!
I am a student at Dapp University! This starter kit is our project called eth_swap. We code 2 smart contracts. I learned how to create a client
side website with React.js. React.js is used for communicating directly to our Eth smart contracts on our local Ganache blockchain.
**********************************************************************
1.) "EthSwap" (smart contract)- code for buying and selling crypto.
2.) "DApp Token" (smart contract)- functions for (educational) token.
**********************************************************************
Each smart contract coded w/Solidity programming language, write test in JavaScript,
and deploy to local blockchain.
